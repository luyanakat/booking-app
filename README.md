# Booking App

A booking-hotel website to making reservations.

### Build and Run Project

#### Create database

Firstly, because the program uses Postgresql to store user data, we need to create and run the database

- Next, we need to create a database named â€œbookings" with the following comand:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE bookings;
  ```

- Install soda-cli to run migration:

  `go install github.com/gobuffalo/pop/v6/soda@latest`

- Run `soda migrate` with terminal in project-folder

- All the needed tables & constrains now created
